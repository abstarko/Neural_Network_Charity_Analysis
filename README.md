# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of Project
Created a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

From Alphabet Soupâ€™s business team, we received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years to use.

## Results
After attempting the model three times we were still unable to reach an accuracy rate of 75%. 

The targe of this model was whether a charity would be able to succeed with an investors support.

The features that can be removed include the name, status and special considerations.

Other features that can be used for the model are the organization, income amount, ask amount, if successful, apllication, affiliation and the classification. 




## Summary
The overall results of the neural network model were pretty good with still having an accuracy right under 75%. If we want to improve that number we could possibly look at other models to use. The next best model I can think of would be the logistic regression model, it would most likely give us close results or slightly better.
